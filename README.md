# Vicitms of Communism

This is my final project for the [Code Cooperative](https://codecooperative.org/) and its dedicated to the people who suffered under communism and who's struggle isn't really known to must of the developed world. I'm not able to cover all of the massacres and atrocities and I'm sure there's other events that isn't even known about but this project is to show respect to those who think no one's remembers, we must remember them.

This isn't to detract attention away from other present inequalities like racism in America or other historically things like the slave trade.
